# To get rid of all the files that have been downloaded multiple times due to filename case sensitivity issues,
# the help of a database server is required!

# First add the database login file to your home folder.
# If you set these differently you can retrieve them via the "env" command

# nano ~/.pgpass
# localhost:5432:Geocities:despens:despens
# chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass

# Directory names will be handled, since this will solve
# issues for most files contained inside of them. To speed things
# up, create a list of all directory names and save it in a file.

# Include conflicts by starting in root of $GEO_WORK directory
cd $GEO_WORK
find . -type d > $GEO_LOGS/dir-index.txt

# Create a database table to hold directory names
# directory names converted to lower case.
# No indexes or constraints are present in the table to enable a swift ingest.

# Make sure your database server is prepared and that you have a 
# .pgpass file in case your db server asks for passwords each 
# time!
