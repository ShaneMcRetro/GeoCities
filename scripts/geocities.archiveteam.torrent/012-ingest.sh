# For some real lowbrow multitasking, split the list file into
# 128 parts to have 4 ingest scripts run at the same time. This helps
# because it seems like startup times of external applications that
# are called by GeoURLs are the main time waster here. This also works
# better if you don't happen to have 16 GB of RAM.
