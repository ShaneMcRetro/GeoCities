Rebuilding GeoCities in 2022 from Archive.org
---------------------------------------------------

This project uses Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as a base.
Failed to use Ubuntu 22.04 as a core component, gvfs-info, has been deprecated.
I am not sure how to resolve that, so we're using 12.04 again.

Time estimates are based on your hardware being:
- Intel Xeon W3520 at 2.67 GHz (4 cores, 8 threads)
- 32 GB PC3-8500 (1066 MHz) DDR3 ECC SDRAM
- 2TB HDD: Torrent source data
- 2TB SSD: Work (tmp) and final archive data

We are merging several sources together:
- The Archive Team GeoCities Snapshot (May 2011)
- GeoCities: Chronomex (compressed inside the above under diomedes.phear.cc)
- GeoCities: JCN Grab (geocities-jcn-pack) (Dec 2011)
- GeoCities: Latecomer (archiveteam-geocities-latecomer) (Mar 2012)
- GeoCities: The Santiago Grab (archiveteam-geocities-santiago) (Jun 2012)

The full list can be found here: https://archive.org/details/archiveteam-geocities

Read the script sources before running them, it might hint what packages you need 
to install and contain instructions on their usage. I believe I've added them all to
the 000a-setup.sh script.

I'll be serving this with Apache so my goal was the raw files decently structured.

Thanks to Dragan Espenschied and others who have helped along the way!
