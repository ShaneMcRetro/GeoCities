Making Sense of the ArchiveTeam's GeoCities Torrent
---------------------------------------------------

This project uses Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as a base.

You need a lot of hard drive space to seriously work with Geocities. I used a pair of SSDs (Samsung 870 EVO).
- 1TB for the source data.
- 2TB for the work and final archive data.
- Drives must be formatted as case-sensitive, such as ext4.

Some scripts will wipe temporary files after they are used. The only versions kept will be:
- the originals (as in how the data was distributed, located in $GEO_SOURCE/geocities.archiveteam.torrent,
- and the finished, workable archive files, located in $GEO_ARCHIVE

Read the script sources before running them, it might hint you towards packages you need to install and contain instructions on their usage.

You're going to need environment variables.

$ sudo nano ~/.bashrc

Replace the username and name your drives appropriately.

export GEO_SOURCE=/media/shane/GC_1TB                   # distribution files, 1TB drive.
export GEO_WORK=/media/shane/GC_2TB/work                # tmp directory
export GEO_ARCHIVE=/media/shane/GC_2TB/archive          # normalised archives

export GEO_LOGS=/media/shane/GC_2TB/log                 # log files and lists
export GEO_SCRIPTS=/media/shane/GC_2TB/scripts          # software
export GEO_SCREENSHOTS=/media/shane/GC_2TB/screenshots  # screenshots dir

export GEO_DB_HOST='localhost'                          # database access
export GEO_DB_DB='Geocities'
export GEO_DB_USER='despens'
export GEO_DB_PASSWD='despens'
