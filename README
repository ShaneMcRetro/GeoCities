Making sense of the Archiveteam's Geocities Torrent
---------------------------------------------------

This project was created on Ubuntu 12.04.

You need a lot of harddrive space to seriously work with Geocities. I
recommend setting up an LVM spanning two 2TB disks. There is still the need
to save space with such a setup, so these scripts will wipe temporary files
after they are used.

The only versions kept will be the originals (as in how the data was
distributed) and the finished, workable archive files.

Read the scripts' sources before running them, it might hint you towards
packages you need to install and contain instructions on their usage.

You need some environment variables, you might set them in your shell's startup
script (i.e. .bashrc):

    export GEO_SOURCE=/media/Geocities/source               # distribution files
    export GEO_WORK=/media/Geocities/work                   # tmp directory
    export GEO_ARCHIVE=/media/Geocities/archive             # normalized archives

    export GEO_LOGS=~/Geocities/scripts/log                 # log files and lists
    export GEO_SCRIPTS=~/Geocities/scripts                  # software
    export GEO_SCREENSHOTS=~/Geocities/archive/screenshots  # screenshots dir

    export GEO_DB_HOST='localhost'                          # database access
    export GEO_DB_DB='Geocities'
    export GEO_DB_USER='despens'
    export GEO_DB_PASSWD='despens'

    With Ubuntu, you may also need to install some perl modules and system deps:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential p7zip-full convmv postgresql libpq-dev gvfs-bin
    $ sudo cpan install IO::All Try::Tiny DBD::Pg DBI XML::TreePP

Notes below by Shane McRetro:
- Still a WIP!
- Increased verbosity of notes for my own benefit.
- Using Ubuntu 22.04 on arm64 with a 1TB SSD (source) and 2TB SSD (work and archive).
