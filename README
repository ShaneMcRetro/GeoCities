Making sense of the Archiveteam's Geocities Torrent
---------------------------------------------------

Using Ubuntu 12.04

You need a lot of harddrive space to seriously work with Geocities. I 
recommend setting up an LVM spanning two 2TB disks. There is still the need 
to save space with such a setup, so these scripts will wipe temporary files
after they are used.

The only versions kept will be the originals (as in how the data was
distributed) and the finished, workable archive files.

Read the scripts' source before running them, it might hint you towards
packages you need to install and contain instructions on their usage.

You need to put this in your shell's startup script (e.g. ~/.bashrc)

  export GEO_SOURCE=/media/Geocities/source         # distribution files
  export GEO_WORK=/media/Geocities/work             # tmp directory
  export GEO_ARCHIVE=/media/Geocities/archive       # normalized archives

I recommend adding scripts/bin to the executable path.
