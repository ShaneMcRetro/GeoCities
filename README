Rebuilding GeoCities in 2022 from Archive.org
---------------------------------------------------

This project uses Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as a base.

Time estimates are based on your hardware being:
- Intel Xeon W3520 at 2.67 GHz (4 cores, 8 threads)
- 32 GB PC3-8500 (1066 MHz) DDR3 ECC SDRAM
- 1TB HDD: Torrent source data
- 2TB SSD: Work (tmp) and final archive data

We are merging several sources together:
- The Archive Team Geocities Snapshot (May 2011)
- Geocities: JCN Grab (geocities-jcn-pack) (Dec 2011)
- Geocities: Latecomer (archiveteam-geocities-latecomer) (Mar 2012)
- Geocities: The Santiago Grab (archiveteam-geocities-santiago) (Jun 2012)

The full list can be found here: https://archive.org/details/archiveteam-geocities

Read the script sources before running them, it might hint what packages you need 
to install and contain instructions on their usage. I believe I've added them all to
the 000a-setup.sh script.

Thanks to Dragan Espenschied and others who have helped along the way!
